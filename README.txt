1. Overview
   --------
   Universal Password Manager (UPM) allows you to store usernames, passwords, URLs,
   and generic notes in an encrypted database protected by one master password.

   There are several open source password managers available so what makes UPM
   different? It's strongest feature is  it's simplicity - it provides a small
   number of very strong features with no clutter.


2. Features
   --------
   .Small, fast and lean
   .Uses AES for database encryption
   .Written in Java/SWING
   .Fast account searching
   .Streamlined for those who are more comfortable using the keyboard only

3. Internationalization
   --------------------
   UPM supports multiple languages. For each language a separate resource bundle
   file is included. UPM includes resource bundles for
     * English
     * Czech
     * German
     * Italian
     * Spanish
   I'd really appreciate help from anyone willing to provide translations for
   UPM's messages. You can find the English resource bundle (upm.properties) in
   the upm.jar file that ships with UPM (Winzip, 7-Zip, or some other zip tool
   can be used to uncompress the JAR file).

   23-Sep-2006 : Version 1.3
      The primary purpose of this release is the introduction of AES database encryption.

      Changes
      - Use the BouncyCastle AES provider to encrypt the database (PBEWithSHA256And256BitAES-CBC-BC)
      - Moved the database structural version out of the encrypted portion of the database.
        This means that UPM can use the database version to decide how to decrypt the database.

      This is primarily a bug fix release.

      Bugs Fixed

      - Tidy up the HTTP proxy code in the HTTPTransport class
      - Don't prompt the user for the password on each database sync
      - Don't bother showing a "success" dialog on each database sync
      - Don't bother asking the user to sync database on application exit
      - Change the status bar message for local databases
      - When user edits and account check if it has changed before marking the database as dirty


   22-Sep-2006 : Version 1.1
